## Sailman - A Web Platform for Sailors

**Sailman** was an ambitious project designed with the sailing community in mind, offering a unique tool for easily searching, adding, and sharing sailing trips. The goal of the platform was to facilitate sailing enthusiasts in discovering new adventures on the water and integrating local sailing communities. Although the project was eventually closed, it brought a wealth of valuable experiences and was a testament to passion and skill in software development.

### Key Features

- **Advanced Listing Filters:** Users could easily search for trips based on location, date, and preferences regarding participation costs.
- **Creating and Managing Trips:** The ability to add your own trips, with important details and tags, and plotting the trip route on the map, which made planning easier.
- **Social Interaction:** The platform offered social features, such as comments and ratings, which helped build trust and better orientation among users.
- **Multilingualism:** Available in Polish and English, increasing the reach and accessibility of the platform for sailors from different regions.
- **Email Notifications:** Automatic notifications about new trips and updates, ensuring users stay informed.

### Technologies

The project was implemented using modern technologies and tools. The frontend was built with **Next.js**, ensuring fast and responsive user interface handling. The backend, based on the **Express framework** in Node.js, provided a solid and flexible solution for application logic handling and database communication.

### Conclusions and Experiences

Although **Sailman** did not survive in the market, this project represents an important chapter in my development career. The experiences gained while working on this ambitious project - from designing the interface, through the development of social functionalities, to the implementation of a multilingual interface - are invaluable. I learned from my own mistakes, improving my programming skills, project management, and adaptation to changing market requirements.

Sailman was proof that passion and hard work can turn a vision into reality, even if ultimate success is not guaranteed. Every experience builds a foundation for future projects, and the lessons learned from Sailman are a priceless asset on my further career path.
